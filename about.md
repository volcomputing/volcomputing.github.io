The Volunteer and Distributed Computing Club is a new student organization at the University of Tennessee
for the 2014-2015 school year.

### Our Purpose

To explore and contribute to the fields of volunteer and distributed computing and use computing technology
to promote the common good.

### Our Activities

We currently act as a loose conglomerate of students maintaining and growing a small computing lab in the
Min Kao building with the assistance of our advisor, Dr. Micah Beck. As of January 2015, we are contributing
to the Folding @ Home project.

### Officers

- President: Alex Klibisz (aklibisz@vols.utk.edu)
- Systems Director: Brandon Denton
- Club Advisor: Dr. Micah Beck (mbeck@eecs.utk.edu)
