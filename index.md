## Welcome!

Vol Computing, the Volunteer and Distributed Computing Club at the University of Tennessee, is a student organization dedicated to using computing technology to promote the common good.  

Our goal is to explorer and contribute to volunteer and distributed computing projects by building and running a computing lab on campus using donated machines and hardware.  

As of January 2016, we have machines contributing simulations to the Folding @ Home project.  

Have a look through our site to learn about the projects we are contributing to, and do not hesitate to contact us if they spark your interest!
