title: Fall 2014 Semester Review
---

As the semester and year comes to a close, we would like to take the opportunity to summarize our club activities for this past semester.

**Bazinga EECS Event, August 21, 2014**

In August we had the opportunity to share ideas for our new club with students participating in the EECS "Bazinga" event organized by the Systers organization. As a brand new club, this was a great opportunity for us to reach out to new members and share our ideas and plans.

**Becoming an official student organization**

After taking some time to figure out the process and speak with representatives of UT's Student Organizations office, we completed and submitted our application to become an official UT student organization in early September and were approved in mid-October.

**Receiving Donations**

In the weeks following our inception as an official student organization at UT, we were fortunate to receive interest from several very generous businesses in the Knoxville area. Cadre5, a local custom software engineering company, Cisco's Knoxville office, and E-Cycle, a local electronics recycler, were all very generous in providing us with PCs and hardware to start our efforts.

**Current State**

Over the break we will have several members taking time to configure the donated PCs and hardware to contribute to several volunteer computing projects. As the Spring semester begins in January we will reconvene meetings and continue working to make contributions to volunteer computing projects that promote the common good.
