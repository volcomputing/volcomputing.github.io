### Why We Need Donations

We currently maintain a small computing lab of roughly five machines contributing to volunteer computing projects 24/7. As such, we are always looking for ways to improve and expand our systems to make a larger contribution.

### Donations for the Vol Computing Lab

To keep our on-campus lab running and growing, we greatly appreciate any of the following donations:

- PCs in working condition
- Graphics cards
- Hard drives and RAM chips
- Money to purchase and maintain the above items

#### To make a donation, email us at [volcomputing@gmail.com](mailto:volcomputing@gmail.com).

### Donor Perks

We appreciate our donors and like to maintain a good relationship with them. We offer the following "perks":

- Publicity: all donors will have their business logos featured on our website.
- Collaboration: all donors are invited to help determine how their donations are used. For example, if you donate a PC to be used for Folding@Home, you can choose which disease it will contribute to.

### Donation Logistics
As an [official student organization at the University of Tennessee](https://utk.collegiatelink.net/organization/volcomputing), we ensure that:

- All donations are documented and kept on record.
- All necessary records are provided to the donor.
- Any usage of the donations will abide strictly by our [club constitution](../documents/Constitution.pdf).
